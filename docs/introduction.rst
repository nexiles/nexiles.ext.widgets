What?
=====

We use ExtJS_ for most of our UI work.  This repository contains some of our widets we use, and the
nexiles theme.


Motivation
==========

Customizing, extending and integrating with `PTC Windchill`_ the usual way needs lots of domain knowledge
and boiler plate setup to get started.

The tooling needed and setup required to do even the simplest tasks is complicated and complex.

Turnaround time and compile-test-deploy cycle time is high.  This results in huge project costs.

Customers today demand fast turnaround and flexibility -- solution providers need to embrace change
even during the project.
